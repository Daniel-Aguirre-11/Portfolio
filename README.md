**This project involved scraping data from a website to create a dataframe showcasing athletes that perfomed in the olympics and medals that were won. Then taking the dataframe and creating a visualization.**

I utilized Jupyter Notebook to scrape the olympics website with BeautifulSoup for data on each athlete that participated in olympics. I added titles and comments to certain blocks of code to help understand what they do. 

**SQL**
