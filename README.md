## Tokyo Olympics 2020

**This project involved scraping data from a website to create a table showcasing athletes that perfomed in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and medals that were won. Then taking the table and creating a visualization.**

### Jupyter Notebook

I usedJupyter Notebook with Python to scrape the olympics website with BeautifulSoup for data. I added titles and comments to certain blocks of code to help understand what they do, along with my thought process. The end result was to create a table of information on each athlete (name, age, team, event, medal, etc.) so that I could answer some questions I had about the Olympics.

### SQL

I then used SQL to answer some questions I had about the data. How many medals did each team win? How many male vs female athletes? How old/young where the participants? etc. I then started writing some qeuries to anser my questions. I landed on the bigest question I came up with, which was "How many medals where won by each Team?". This question is what I decided to visualize in Tableau.

### Tableau Visualization

I created a simple interactive map dashboard that would display the total medals earned along with the individual athletes for each team. When a location is clicked on the map, that teams information will populate on the right side of the dashboard.
